					<h3>Discovery and Research</h3>
					<p>During the discovery phase I’ll learn the client’s business goals, needs, wants, wishes, deepest fears, and wildest dreams. Everybody’s got a vision, and this is the stage where I get to learn all about it! I’ll assess the project requirements and do things like a competitive analysis and user research. I’ll review existing analytics, begin a content audit, and work to create a spectacular business solution and website plan.</p>

					<h3>Prototype and IA</h3>
					<p>The information architecture (IA) is one of the most crucial parts of any successful website. Before starting the design, it’s essential to organize the content so that users can effortlessly navigate the website. To determine the most logical organization of content, I’ll conduct a card sorting exercise and then build the determined navigation into wireframes.</p>

					<h3>Design</h3>
					<p>The design phase is always exciting. Watching some rough wireframes come to life with colours and personality is like seeing your dreams become reality! Thoughtful UI (user interface) design is a key part of the process - I make decisions based on how to best serve the audience. A user shouldn’t have to think too hard while browsing a website. It should be intuitive and beautifully laid out, hopefully even triggering a spark of joy!</p>

					<h3>Develop</h3>
					<p>I write front end code such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I’ve always loved starting with a beautiful design and finding creative, accessible methods of coding out a responsive webpage. I care a lot about web accessibility. I’ve been trained to perform accessibility audits of websites and ask myself before I put anything online - “does this serve the entire population as well as it possibly can? Is this design and functionality inclusive?” The answer should always be yes!</p>
